# JourneyGenius Python Flask Backend

### The following are instructions to get the basic JourneyGenius python flask backend running on your machine. 

**Important Note: This has been tested to work on Mac, instructions may vary for Windows.**  

**If you are running a Mac with an M1 chip or newer, I highly recommend you use Homebrew, as it makes package installation much smoother.**

### To install Homebrew:  
1. Paste the following command into your terminal:  
   ```
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```  
   This can take a while, so make sure to wait until it is finished. 

### To setup running environment:


1. Download the "Flask Introduction" folder from this branch
2. Open the "Flask Introduction" in your IDE and **MAKE SURE** your terminal is in that directory  
  **This is essential because it isolates any necessary environment installations to this directory without having to deal with globally installed packages throughout your machine!**
3. In your IDE terminal, paste and run the following commands individually:  

     
   Install VirtualEnv:  
   ```
   pip3 install virtualenv
   ```
   Create virtual environment:  
   ```
   virtualenv env
   ```
   Activate virtual environment:  
   ```
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
   Install project dependencies:
   ```
   pip3 install flask flask_sqlalchemy flask_login flask_bcrypt flask_wtf wtforms email_validator
   ```

### To access running application on a web browser:
1. To run the application, paste the following commands one at a time into your IDE terminal:  
   ```
   flask shell
   ```
   ```
   from app import db
   ```
   ```
   db.create_all()
   ```
   ```
   exit()
   ```
   ```
   python3 app.py
   ```  
2. Enter the following in your web browser search bar:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```  
   
**This should install all the necessary packages to run the basic Python Flask Framework for JourneyGenius.**
